                <p>Thank you for enrolling in Mid-Atlantic Finance Company's ("MAF") AutoPay-Recurring Payment program.</p>
                <p>I Authorize MAF to make electronic funds payment via ACH to my MAF auto loan account. Payment will be debited from the checking or saving account I provided to MAF. I am either a named owner or authorized representative of the ACH account and the name(s) on the ACH account or documents providing authorization match the name(s) of my MAF account.</p>
                <p>I understand payments will be automatically debited from the ACH account number provided in accordance with each scheduled payment due date in the respective payment amount. Payments will be automatically debited on a recurring basis with no further action on my part.</p>
                <p>Payments may be processed by CallPass Tech Pay System ("CallPass"), an independent third-party; however, each payment will be credited to my MAF account. CallPass will not charge a convenience fee for processing of recurring ACH payment. It may take up to the 48 hours for payment to post to MAF accounts. Your ACH account statement may reflect "CallPass Tech" as the Payee. Subscribers to the AutoPay-Recurring Payment program may incur a service charge assessed by your financial institution.</p>
                <p>MAF will not be liable for any delays connected with the AutoPay-Recurring Payment program.</p>
                <p>This Authorization will remain in effect until the debt is satisfied or until cancelled by either party. I understand I may cancel through my online account, by sending a text message, by contacting MAF's Accounts Servicing department at (800) 793-9661 ext. 600 or by submitting written notice. Electronic requests will be processed by the next scheduled payment due date provided a request is made more than 2 business days prior to that date.
